Character codes 128 to 159 (U+0080 to U+009F) are not allowed in HTML;
even if they were, they would likely be unprintable control characters.
Tidy assumed you wanted to refer to a character with the same byte value in the 
specified encoding and replaced that reference with the Unicode equivalent.

The table summary attribute should be used to describe
the table structure. It is very helpful for people using
non-visual browsers. The scope and headers attributes for
table cells are useful for specifying which headers apply
to each table cell, enabling non-visual browsers to provide
a meaningful context for each cell.

The alt attribute should be used to give a short description
of an image; longer descriptions should be given with the
longdesc attribute which takes a URL linked to the description.
These measures are needed for people using non-graphical browsers.

service for checking URLs for accessibility.

You are recommended to use CSS to specify the font and
properties such as its size and color. This will reduce
the size of HTML files and make them easier to maintain
compared with using <FONT> elements.
